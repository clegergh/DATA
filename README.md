Technical aspects will include evolving approaches to script-based web scraping, file formats and conversions, data mergers and tidying, meta-data organization and capture.\
In parallel, the course will cover theoretical and ethical aspects of data curation and access policies, development of best practices for research data management and case studies in secure management of sensitive or private data.

In my experience with github, I have installed many apps from source on Linux (my OS of choice for a while). I have published a bit, but mostly just for backups.
